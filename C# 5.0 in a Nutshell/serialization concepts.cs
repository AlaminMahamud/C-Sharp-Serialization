// Serialization is the act of taking an in-memory object or object graph (set of objects
//that reference each other) and flattening it into a stream of bytes or XML nodes that
//can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization works in reverse, taking a data stream
//and reconstituting it into an in-memory object or object graph.

//Serialization and deserialization are typically used to:
// • Transmit objects across a network or application boundary.
// • Store representations of objects within a file or database.

//Another, less common use is to deep-clone objects. The data contract and XML
//serialization engines can also be used as general-purpose tools for loading and saving
//XML files of a known structure.
